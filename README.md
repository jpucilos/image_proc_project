# image_proc_project

Final Project for CPE 462 at the Stevens Institute of Technology. 

## Collaborators:

* Brereton Conway
* Daniel Pinto
* Joseph Puciloski

## Background

Color blindness (color vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world. There are three main kinds of color blindness, based on photopigment defects in the three different kinds of cones that respond to blue, green, and red light. Red-green color blindness is the most common, followed by blue-yellow color blindness. A complete absence of color vision —total color blindness – is rare.

## Objectives:

* Create an image filter to simulate the effects of certain types of color blindness

* Create an image filter to make images more visible to the colorblind, using Dalton's Method\*

## Tools Used

* Python 3.4
  * PIL
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  
  
\*The Dalton Method is described in part II section D of this paper https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f473f5f11fc340ebf8782b781ecdcd42bfc8f644.pdf
